# Annotations

This folder contains image annotations JSONs.

A pose annotation for a single pose rendering should be of the following format:
	
	{
	"category":1,
	"position":{
		"x":0.1,
		"y":-0.2,
		"z":0.3
		},
	"orientation":{
		"x":0.5,
		"y":-0.3,
		"z":0.67,
		"w":-0.38
		}
	}
	
Orientations are given in quaternion notation, positions relative to the camera intrinsics.
